# About me

I've always been fascinated by data. As we move deeper into the digital age, it’s clear that data will continue to shape how we live, work, and think. I want to be part of the cohort shaping that future—by extracting powerful insights from data and asking meaningful questions along the way.
For years, my interest in data was mostly philosophical. I found myself pondering questions like:
* "At what point does AI, trained on user behavior data, begin to meaningfully influence or override individual decision-making—and how can that inflection point be detected, measured, and studied empirically?"
* How will increased access to data reshape our society?
* When do we reach the point of diminishing returns with data?

Only recently did I decide to complement those questions with technical skills. I took my first data analytics course and immediately knew I’d found something that truly resonated with me. Since then, I’ve thrown myself into learning—building projects in Python, studying the foundations of statistical learning, and refining my analytical thinking every day.

My journey so far has been autodidactic, fueled by curiosity and a drive to better understand the world through data. I’m excited to share my projects here and connect with others who are just as passionate about exploring and analyzing the world around us.

#### Looking forward to connecting with you!
